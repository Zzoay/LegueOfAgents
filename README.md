#  League of Agents: Large Laguage Models for LOL Character Chat, Story Generation, and More

本项目旨在利用大规模语言模型，为《英雄联盟》中的英雄生成身临其境的对话和引人入胜的故事。我们希望开发一种工具，用游戏中的世界观和角色故事提示LLM，可以模拟与您最喜爱英雄的互动，甚至在符文之地中创作全新的故事。

This project aims to use the power of large language model to generate immersive dialogues and captivating stories for the legends in "League of Legends". By prompting a LLM with in-game lore and character stories, we aspire to create a tool that can simulate interactions with your favorite legends or even craft entirely new tales within the world of Runeterra.

我们将从中文版开始，随后完成英文版。我们将首先进行数据采集，然后为LLM驱动的人物对话设计提示方法。

We will start with the Chinese version and subsequently complete the English version. We will first engage in data scraping, followed by designing prompts for LLM-driven character dialogues.
